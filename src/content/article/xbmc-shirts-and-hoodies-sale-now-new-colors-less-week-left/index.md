This is just a quick reminder for those of you not on the social networks that the [XBMC Beta shirt and hoodie sale](https://teespring.com/xbmcbeta1shirt) has less than a week to go, and after that we won’t be selling this particular design again, possibly forever.

Also, since the beta 1 announcement, we’ve added a few more shirt colors (royal blue, purple, pure black) after numerous requests. So you might check the list again if you didn’t like the first available options.

If you’ve already bought your swag, or if you are only here fore the [free software](https://kodi.wiki/xbmc-13-0-gotham-beta1-rises/ "XBMC beta 1"), feel free to disregard this post.
