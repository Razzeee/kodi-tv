It took a bit longer than expected due to a few bumps in the road, but we are excited to present the first preview release of (what we consider to be) the best version of the best home theater software out there.

Ladies and Gentlemen, XBMC 11.0 Eden: Beta 1 is available to [download](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "XBMC Eden Download").

The sheer number of new features, platforms, and improvements to nearly every facet of the XBMC experience found within Eden are nearly too numerous to count.

Milestones include [Addon Rollbacks](https://kodi.wiki/natethomas/2011/10/20/xbmc-addon-rollbacks/ "XBMC Rollback Review"), vast improvements in [Confluence](https://kodi.wiki/natethomas/2011/10/07/xbmc-eden-skinning-changes/ "Confluence Update Review") (the default skin), massive speed increases via features like Dirty-region rendering and the new JPEG decoder, a simpler, better library, additional protocol handling, better networking support, better handling of unencrypted BluRay content and structures, adjustable display refresh rate in OSX (to match the already available feature in Windows and Linux), AirPlay support, an upgraded [weather service](https://www.wunderground.com/ "Thanks for your support, Weather Underground!"), and much more. Check out the highlights in the [summarized changelog](http://mirrors.xbmc.org/releases/11.0-Eden_beta1-changelog.txt).

In addition to our many software improvements, we’ve increased our reach in the realm of hardware support since Dharma was released. Eden marks the first in-sync stable release for the [Apple TV2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1NK0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thfefi02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001FA1NK0 "Apple TV 2"), [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/ "iPad"), and other iOS devices. We’ve vastly improved the method by which we handle input, including heavily upgrading JSON-RPC support, making remote control support much, MUCH simpler in Windows, and enabling unique methods of device communication with hardware like the [HDMI-CEC Adapter](https://www.pulse-eight.com/store/products/104-usb-hdmi-cec-adapter.aspx "USB CEC Adapter"). And now even AMD devices are supported for GPU video decoding in Linux to some extent, thanks to the inclusion of [VAAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API "VAAPI Wiki Page").

We are also in the process of drastically altering XBMC Live to make it more like a full “\*Buntu” version of XBMC with massive changes to the boot and install process. That alteration is not quite ready for prime time (and, thus, is not available at this time), but our devs are working on it round the clock. Keep an eye out for a more in-depth article on this in the next week or so. The XBMC Linux PPA is also not immediately available, but check back a few days after Christmas. It should be online at that time.

Because this is Beta software, you can likely expect minor issues over the course of the next few weeks. For example, you may discover issues with playing movie trailers that may require a manual install of the Youtube addon. If, after asking in the forum and updating to the most recently available Beta, your issue is not solved, feel free to follow the above link to the Trac service and create a ticket with the issue. As always, when troubleshooting, providing a [debug log](https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file "Info about XBMC Debug Logs") will be essential to resolving issues.

And with that, we invite users one and all to backup your [userdata folder](https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata_folder "XBMC Userdata folder Wiki") (which is always a good idea)(also, iOS users, you should follow [this link](https://kodi.wiki/view/IOS_FAQ "Backing up XBMC for iOS") for info on your slightly different backup process), and get to downloading!

Downloads may be found [here](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "XBMC Downloads").

Let us know what you think in the comments. Spread the word. XBMC Eden Beta is finally available!
