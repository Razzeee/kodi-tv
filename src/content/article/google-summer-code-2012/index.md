![](/images/blog/GSoC2012x1103x728-300x198.jpeg "GSoC2012x1103x728")A quick note to let our users know that we have applied to be a sponsor for this year’s [GSOC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/?csw=1). Some of you may recall that we were accepted a few years ago, and [by proxy](https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC/2010_Projects/XBMC) thanks to the BeagleBoard project in 2010.

We’re confident that the recent buzz from the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/xbmc-running-on-raspberry-pi/) among other things will help this year, though it’s always a fierce competition. If you are interested in applying, please head to our [project page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code_2012) and begin thinking of what you might like to hack on!
