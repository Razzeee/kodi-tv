[![](/images/blog/20120902-174239-300x224.jpeg "DevCon.jpeg")](/images/blog/20120902-174239.jpeg)Our apologies to Vienna users. The lack of consistent internet plus the incredible amount of discussion and work that we’ve managed over the past two days has made it next to impossible to put together and adequately advertise a Meetup in time. Even as this post is being written, we’re STILL discussing potential UI upgrades!

Thanks to all those users who expressed interest in the comments! More interest has been expressed this year than ever before. We’ll do our best to make it happen next time.

We should have a full recap of all the many topics we covered at this DevCon within the week. For a VERY informal recap, feel free to check out the [LiveBlog](http://xbmc.us/njbetzen/2012/08/30/xbmc-devcon-liveblog/ "XBMC DevCon Liveblog") posted over at xbmc.us.
