Our very own Jonathan Marshall will be there hosting an XBMC booth along with David Teirney. Check out the full list of exhibitors [here](https://conf.linux.org.au/wiki/OpenDay#Open_Day_Stalls).

For those of you on the other side of the world near Los Angeles, be sure to visit the [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/), where Sean Soria (malloc) and Cory Fields (hey thatâ€™s me!) will be hosting a booth February 20th-21st. The full list of exhibitors is [here](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale8x/exhibitors).

If you get the opportunity, please drop by and introduce yourself. Bonus points for anyone who makes it to both.
