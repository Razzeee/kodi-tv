As you might know, your donations help us deliver a great media center experience with Kodi. In addition to PayPal, Patreon, Bitpay, and wire transfer, we are happy to announce that you can now also support us with a recurring donation on **Liberapay** [here](https://liberapay.com/teamkodi). Liberapay is a recurrent donation platform similar to Patreon.

Donations are used solely for purchasing hardware to improve and extend the goals of the Kodi Foundation, travel for conferences, and administrative costs and fees. We ask that if you find the software useful, and would like to support our efforts, please consider donating what you think the software is worth.

All donations are tax-deductible in the United States: our EIN is: 47-4565769.
