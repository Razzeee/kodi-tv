Hold your breath

Make a wish

Count to three

 Where the Magic Happens

Come with me to the home of Lutz, one of our Germany XBMC users. Lutz’s home doesn’t have a bat cave or any other kind of man cave. There are no super creative touch screens or repurposed upstairs bedrooms. In fact, the intro to this post aside, Lutz doesn’t even proudly display any delicious Milka chocolate or Haribo. What Lutz does have is oodles and oodles of candy.

Tech candy, to be specific.

As a rule, I try to be as jealous as possible of everyone who submits a Feature Friday. Lutz may just take the cake for most assorted things I want.

Sure, he’s got the basic things. For example, he’s got an AMD dual core computer with 5tb of storage running Win7 Pro 64 and [XBMC](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "Download XBMC"), and he’s outputting his sound using an [ASUS Xonar DS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VAD716/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thfefi02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002VAD716 "ASUS Xonar DS"), for one of the cleanest consumer analog outputs on the market, and certainly one of the best cards out there for receivers that don’t accept HDMI in.

Of course, he’s got a PS3, a DM 800HD PVR, and a Kenwood 5.1 receiver.

And, naturally, it goes without saying that he controls all these things with a top of the line [Harmony 900](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IC0YL8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thfefi02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=B002IC0YL8 "Harmony 900 Remote") remote.

At this point, you’d think Lutz would be content. Maybe toss a nifty TV into the system and some speakers and call it a day.

Instead, Lutz installed some of the most interesting surround speakers I’ve ever seen into the corners of his room.

Then he stuck a fully motorized [110 inch 16:9 screen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLW0GM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thfefi02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B000JLW0GM "110 Projection Screen") on his wall.

He mounted his apparently infinite supply of bluray movies onto his wall.

Then he stuck the [BenQ W600+](https://www.benq.com/en-us/products/product_detail.cfm?product=1699&pltag=7&ptag=88 "BenQ product page") 3D [projector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L7VH1K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thfefi02-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B003L7VH1K "BenQ projector on Amazon") on the wall to give his living room that “My room is better than yours” look.

Now, as you can see from every angle, his room is a candy land of awesome for many an XBMC lover.

All jokes of jealousy aside, Lutz really did put together a room that any XBMC lover ought to love hanging out in. Good job Lutz!

And if any of the rest of you have anything creative or awesome you’d like to share, don’t hesitate to drop me a line at natethomas AT xbmc DOT org, or just leave a note on the [Facebook Fanpage](https://www.facebook.com/XBMC "XBMC Fanpage"), or shoot a tweet to [@XBMC](https://twitter.com/ "XBMC on Twitter") or @natedrives. I should be able to get in contact in with you in at least one of those ways. Meanwhile, stay tuned for next week, when I’m going to try to pin down a very special guest for Celebrity Feature Friday!

(note: all celebrities are not actually celebrities)
