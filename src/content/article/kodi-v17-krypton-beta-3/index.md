Kodi 17 features a huge amount of work in areas like video playback, live TV and PVR/DVR, the music library, skinning and more. It features a new default skin, as well as a new default touchscreen skin, named Estuary and Estouchy, respectively. With all this work done over the months some bugs might slip through and were hoping to quickly squash the coming beta releases. The changes for this third beta are the result of the continuous effort from the developers, either from inside the team or outside to get v17 into final release shape. and any outside. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with question. Below is a condensed list of fixes and changes done in this beta 3 release.

## What’s new?

Next to the list of fixes we also added some features we thought would certainly help along the usability of Kodi. With this beta a long awaited feature was added since the early days of Eden (v11) or even earlier. As most of you know on each new Kodi version there are certain database changes which happen on the first start of Kodi after you upgraded. On some devices this might be over quite fast however for some slower devices this might seem like Kodi has frozen while it was actually finishing the database upgrade. We did acknowledge this problem and have always wanted to add a some message on the Kodi splash screen telling users what is actually happening. We with this v17 beta version we finally had the ability to add this feature given the fact enough pre-work had been done making this possible. Additionally what now happens is that on the first upgrade our add-on manager will fetch the latest available add-ons for that specific versions and will process these before going to Kodi home screen itself. One of the most noticeable problems before was when you had a non default skin installed, after upgrade the screen went black and it started installing the new skin version. Now all this happens during the first start and you’ll see a nice message saying it’s processing the upgrade. Depending on the amount of installed skins, add-ons and internet connection speed this could take a while. So please, don’t turn of your device during this initial startup period.

Next notable change is the way the settings sliders work. I’m sure we all came across them one way or another in the Kodi setting screen or in some add-ons and struggled navigating around them. You tried to go to the left or right but then you accidentally changed the slider setting and had to set it back again. From now on you don’t have this problem any more because you will first need to highlight the slider, click on it and then you can adjust it’s settings. Once satisfied just click again and you can navigate freely to the next control on the window. If the slider has two nibbles on it that control the setting then the process is the same but you first move to the next nibble and then you accept it. Although this a small change it was one of those annoyances that made navigation in Kodi not always easy.

Windows Store

[![KODI_BLOG_WIN_300x300_C](/images/blog/KODI_BLOG_WIN_300x300_C-160x160.jpeg)](href=https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/kodi/9nblggh4t892?cid=koditvlin)In case you missed the big news some time ago, Kodi got added to the Windows Store as a Desktop Bridge UWP app. It is still the same Kodi version you are used to use, without any limitations. Although it is still possible (and always will be) to download and install Kodi from our website, it is now also possible for Windows 10 users to download and install Kodi from the Windows Store. This brings a few benefits, such as automatic updating. The Windows Store application uses the same _userdata_ as the version from our website so you can switch between the two versions without issues. NOTE: This also means that if you are currently running Kodi v16 and want to try out the Windows Store version, your Kodi databases and add-ons will be upgraded to the v17 versions. You might want to make a backup of the userdata before! You can read the full announcement here: [Kodi goes Windows Store](/article/kodi-goes-windows-store)

**NOTE**: Since it takes a bit of time to publish in Windows Store you might need to wait a bit till the update is available.

All in all this Beta 3 might not seem very excited but that’s how it’s supposed to be. We’re simply focusing more on stability and working out the details than keep adding bells and whistles.
