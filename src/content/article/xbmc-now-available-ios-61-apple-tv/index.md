[![appletv_2ndgen](/images/blog/appletv_2ndgen.jpeg)](/images/blog/appletv_2ndgen.jpeg)As many of you likely have been aware, neither XBMC nor any other non-Apple media center has been available for the updated Apple TV 2 Software 5.2 (iOS 6.1).

Now, we are pleased to announce that XBMC finally supports this update, thanks to the incredible work of XBMC dev Memphiz.

To get your updates on, head over to our wiki and follow the instructions for [Apple TV version 5.0 and up](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_XBMC_on_Apple_TV_2 "XBMC install instructions for the Apple TV").
