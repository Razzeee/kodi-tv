We are proud to announce the first beta of Kodi 14.2 in which we further try to improve stability. As you may all know by now, we have a new name, a new logo, and a wide variety of new features, but underneath the new coat of paint remains the same software we all love. 14.2 beta 1 is the second of the small bugfix releases in the Helix range. As we have mentioned in our Kodi 14.0 [release announcement,](/article/kodi-140-helix-unwinds) we will be releasing these to squash down any issues left after the first final release. Below you will find a list of fixes so far. In the Kodi 14.1 [release announcement](/article/kodi-141-helix-bugfix-release) you can find the sum up of previous fixes done in the Helix range.

 Fixes so far
------------

 
 * * Fix: Application stopped responding on Windows
 * * Fix: Gap-less playback on MP3
 * * Fix: Playback of rtmp protocol
 * * Fix: Scanning of newly added episodes
 * * Fix: Fix multipath source scanning

 Finally, the bug that haunted us in the 14.0 and 14.1 release has been solved. Windows should be stable again and perform as it should.

 A Few Warnings and Notices
--------------------------

 This release marks the switch to the new name Kodi. When you install this releases , your library and add-ons will be moved to Kodi, making reverting back to 13.2 fairly difficult. As such, it is recommended that you [back up your library](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Backup_the_library "How to backup the library") [as well as your settings](https://kodi.wiki/view/Backing_up_XBMC) before installing Kodi.

 If you are using a skin other than the default Confluence, it is possible that you may find the software keyboard blank as a result of the previously mentioned keyboard layout upgrade. If so, you need to either switch to a new skin, or see if your skin has a Helix update. While Kodi automatically checks for addon and skin updates, you can speed up this process by visiting the add-ons browser from the settings menu and selecting use the context menu for doing”Check for updates” or “force refresh”

 Also, as Kodi is an unsigned application on OSX, you may need to go through a slightly different process to start it the first time. After you have copied Kodi to the Applications folder, you will need to “right click” or “two finger click” Kodi from within the Applications folder and select “Open” and then accept the warning. You should only need to do this the first time you run Kodi.

 Download
--------

 This time we will provide the downloads from a specific forum thread to gather feedback on stability and possible regressions. All the downloads are listed in the first post. To upgrade from any previous build, just install on top of your current version.
