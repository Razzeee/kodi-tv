For the third year in a row, Kodi is attending CES.

 CES, also known as the Consumer Electronics Show, is an internationally renowned electronics and technology trade show, attracting major companies and industry professionals worldwide.

 Why do we go there?
-------------------

 Our purpose and goal behind attending CES is so we can reach and interact with companies who use and/or might benefit from using our platform and of course the end user. Especially since we started supporting Android, many more companies are jumping on board wanting to ship with Kodi and we want to make sure they’re using our standard unmodified build available from our [website](/download) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi). This to make sure the users are getting the software we are proud of creating and not software that misuses our trademarked name.

 Working with Kodi is easy and opens you up to a massive ecosystem of an already established platform and user-base. We’re actively seeking out content providers that are interested in an official add-on, doing hardware integration such as home automation, or anything you can think of we might be a good fit.

 Kodi can run in practically any configuration. Besides as home entertainment systems Kodi is also showing up in digital signage systems, schools media distributions, hospitality systems in high end hotels and even Yachts or cruise ships! We love to see how far companies and our users can take it.

 Interested in meeting us?
-------------------------

 So if you know anyone at such a company (or work there yourself) and you think you should have a meeting with us, please put us in contact with them, or give them our email: biz at kodi dot tv and we’ll be happy to schedule a meeting, even if you can’t make it to CES.

 This year SiliconDust has graciously allow us to share their suite with them, so while we won’t on the official list, we should have a private space to take meetings. Please do not drop-in, this is for serious business inquiries only. If you want to talk to us, email us at biz at kodi dot tv and we will try to fit you into the busy schedule.
