![tv-icon](/images/blog/tv-icon.jpeg "tv-icon")As many of our forum users have pointed out, thetvdb.com is currently down. This notice is a bit late, it seems that they’ve been having trouble all weekend.

Obviously, as thetvdb is the default TV scraper for XBMC, many of you will not be able to scrape your shows. Not to worry though, they know about the problem and are moving their server to a new datacenter. You can watch for a status update over at [their forum](https://forums.thetvdb.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2246). Until they’re back up, please be patient and don’t file tickets about the issue.

Site and scraper are back up. Thanks to everyone over at [TheTVDB.com](https://www.thetvdb.com/) for the hard work and quick response.
