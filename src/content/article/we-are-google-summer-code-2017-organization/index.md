We are excited to announce that Kodi has been [accepted as a Google Summer of Code 2017 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/5704018827411456/)! Students, as of the time of this publication, you have about [2 or 3 weeks](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline) to start thinking about project ideas.

 If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [project Ideas page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code/2017 "GSOC 2015 Kodi Ideas page") and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on. Also, visit our [GSOC 2017 subforum](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=274) and feel free to submit ideas or just introduce yourself.

 Weâ€™re ready to get going this summer and to see what ideas you come up with!
