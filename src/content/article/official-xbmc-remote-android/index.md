![](/images/blog/android-logo-white.jpeg-101x101.jpeg "android-logo-white.jpeg")![](/images/blog/qrcode.jpeg "qrcode")Nearly a year ago, topfs2 started working on a remote client for Android phones and was shortly joined by me, not even having my phone yet. The project grew rapidly and soon the_alien and mikkle joined the show. While the app was always freely available via [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-xbmcremote), we’ve decided today that it’s time for a public beta release on Android Market. It’s still not final, but we’ve received much positive feedback from users, and after all a Market distribution is much more convenient for both us developers as well as the users.

There is still a lot to do, but the basics should work fairly well. Besides using the app as pure remote control with the look of the famous Xbox DVD Dongle, you’ll be able to browse your music, movie and TV shows library. Browse through your albums by genre or artist, select or queue an album without even turning on your television? No problem. Make incoming calls automagically pause the film you’re watching? Go to settings and check the option. You can find a complete list of features on the [project page](https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-xbmcremote). Also check out the [screenshots gallery](https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-xbmcremote/wikis/Gallery.wiki).

You’ll need at least Android v1.5 (Cupcake) and XBMC v9.11 (Camelot) in order to run it correctly. Also, XBMC’s coming up Dharma release will be fully supported. If you have a suggestion or find a bug, please use our [issue tracker](https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-xbmcremote/issues) and not the comments in Android Market. If you need discuss other stuff you’re not sure about, use [our forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=129). We are looking forward to your comments and suggestions!
