Once again we will be exhibit between the 8th and 10th of May at [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/en/ "LinuxTag") in Berlin, Germany. This will be our sixth year attending.

 This year will be really different, new exhibition halls, new partners [droidcon](https://www.de.droidcon.com/2014 "droidcon") and [re:publica](https://re-publica.com/en).

 Of course we want you to join us at the booth, chat with us and let us know what you think.

 We will be running several demo systems on different platforms, for instance Raspberry Pi. Sraue from OpenELEC will also attend this year. Android boxes will be displayed too.

 For everyone using XBMC and on location in Berlin, we are having a meetup at some nice pub/bar. So come and grab a few beers and mingle with us!

 Since we are not native Berliners, suggestion on good bars, pubs and restaurants are more than welcome.
