**Thanks for all your suggestions!  
 We decided to go with the most popular suggestion from the community and have selected 
Krypton
  as the code name for Kodi v17** !

   
 Since the dawn of time, or at least since 2008 each released version has received a code name next to the version number. Giving each development iteration a code name in a certain category is kind of a tradition that is not only applicable for software but also for hardware. Google does so for Android and Intel also names their chips. Who are we to break this tradition and as such we follow in their steps with a theme that started out with mythical places or names.

 With Kodi v16 *Jarvis* almost being final (just waiting on some fixes) we’ ll need a new code name that will be added to v17 which our developers are already working on. Don’ t worry we’ ll still look after any bug that might pop up in Jarvis and try to fix it first.

 Below are the code names we have used in the past to give you an idea.

 As you can see we now arrived at the next version that will start with the letter K. We thought it might be a good idea to ask the users to send in suggestions on what the next code name should be. You can post your suggestions on our forum [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=232133)

 So up to you to suggest a great code name that will be added to Kodi v17
