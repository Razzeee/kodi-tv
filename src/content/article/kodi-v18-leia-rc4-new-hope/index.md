 It's the days between Christmas and New Years eve, and some of our developers found the time do squash down some know issues. We hereby present you v18 RC4 that include several fixes we did past two weeks. There's not really anything more to say than wish you all a great new year. As you might have guessed by now v18 will not be released in 2018. There are several reason for this, however we feel we shouldn't rush a release just for the sake of releasing. There's good hope it will be released very early 2019 once we ironed out the remaining issues we feel should be fixed.

 To this point the current v18 version has been proven to be quite solid to use as a daily driver for those who were brave enough to try it out. Of course you should still keep in mind it's not a final release yet and that on any upgrade a small glitch could happen as we are still doing rework. Once you decide to give it a try it is highly recommended that you create a backup first.

 Changes in RC4 (and RC3)
------------------------

 Most notable changes to mention in this Release Candidate:

 Currently included
------------------

 The past RC1 and RC2 release articles include the most notable changes we have done in v18. There are of course many smaller changes and improvements that we can't even remember. I guess you will just have to try and find out eventually. For a more extensive list you can visit our wiki page [v18 (Leia) changelog](https://kodi.wiki/view/Kodi_v18_(Leia)_changelog) which will be update along the way. From now on all v18 releases will not contain any big new features as we are focussed on bug fixing or improvements only.

 Make sure to also go through our **[news](https://kodi.tv/blog)** sections which contain all past announcements regarding the Leia release and some highlights of what it will contain.

 #### The V18 Leia t-shirt

 Inspired by the galaxy far, far away theme, our resident artist Sam went above and beyond and designed perhaps the coolest Kodi announce video of all time.

  

  We loved his work so much that we're modelling the Kodi 18 shirt after it along with more art to come. Here it is, our [newest, coolest shirt: K-18L](https://teespring.com/stores/kodi-18-leia-store)  
(Available in several shirt **colours** and not just black or white)

  #### **Release time**

 Since we now started the RC cycle a final release will be on the near horizon. When the final release will actually be is yet unknown as it all depends on the stability now more people will start using the v18 builds.

 That’s about it for now and we’ll go back at improving this upcoming v18 release. Should you wish to give it a try a new version is readily available each day as well as nightly version. We can certainly recommend trying it out however take in mind that it’s not fully production and living room ready yet (take a backup). So far a guestimate of several tens of thousands users already use it so it can’t be that bad can it. You can get it from the download page clicking on the platform of choice and hitting the “pre release” tab. For [Android](https://kodi.tv/addon/scripts/kodi-android-installer) and [Windows](https://kodi.tv/addon/scripts/kodi-windows-installer) we have an easy to use download add-on which you can find in our repository.

 *Go to the [Official download page](https://kodi.tv/download) and choose the platform of choice and you will find these builds under the pre release tab.*
