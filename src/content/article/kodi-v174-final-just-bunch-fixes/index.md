It has been a while since we released 17.3 release which fixed several issues. Now the time has come to do another named 17.4 where we tackled several more issues that were identified. Although we already moved on with development towards v18 we do take the time to fix issues for the current release when we can. We recommend every one to upgrade to this version once it's available for their platform to have the best experience possible. If you want to know what has changed you can browse the list below.

#### What else is new?

In the bugfix releases we never include any new features. They are as feature complete as the initial version with the difference is they contain stability and usability fixes. If you are curious you can read up on all the v17 changes here: [Kodi v17.0 “Krypton”](https://kodi.tv/kodi17)

#### Where can I download Kodi?

As alway you can find the official builds on our [download page](https://kodi.tv/download). Then click on the platform of choice and select the build you need. You can install these build just on top of your current Kodi installation without doing a reinstall or cleanup as we do a full migration if needed. All you add-ons or installed skin will keep working.

##### Apparel, donations or getting involved

Getting involved is quite easy. We encourage you to report problems with these builds on our forum first and after that, if asked, submit bugs on Trac (following this guide: [How to submit a bug report](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Submit_a_bug_report)). Do note that we need detailed information so we can investigate the issue. We also appreciate providing support in our [Forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/ "Kodi Forums") where you can. You can of course also follow or help promote Kodi on all available social networks. Read more on the [get involved](https://kodi.tv/get-involved) page. We are always happy to receive a [donation](https://kodi.tv/contribute/donate "Donate") by which you show your support and appreciation, and t-shirts and Raspberry Pi cases may still be found on the sidebar for purchase. All donations and other income goes towards the XBMC foundation and are typically used for travel to attend conferences, any necessary paperwork and legal fees, purchasing necessary hardware and licenses for developers and hopefully the yearly XBMC Foundation Developers Conference.
