![](/images/blog/logo.jpeg "XBMC")The second testing release in the Camelot series has been tagged and is now available for general consumption. The first Alpha was a great success; all of the known issues listed in the previous announcement have been fixed, along with a slew of others. All of those who are currently using Alpha1 are strongly encouraged to update. Though the same warnings still apply: this should be treated as pre-release software and is only for those who donâ€™t mind running into a few bugs.

Thank you to all of you who reported [quality bug reports](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO_submit_a_proper_Bug_Report), we closed a whopping 103 tickets between the version tags!
