[![](/images/blog/Original_Xbox-300x213.jpeg "Original Xbox")](/images/blog/Original_Xbox.jpeg)As you should all know by now, Team XBMC does not maintain a build for the original Xbox. With that said, a few valiant souls have continued to port over some of the more beneficial lines of XBMC code and done other bug fixing the keep the aging Xbox as a valid option for many people out there. To this day, though more than 10 years old, the Xbox 1 remains one of the best boxes in the world for gaming, pictures, and SD video playback.

Unfortunately, the dev team at our sister site XBMC4Xbox is currently dealing with some hosting problems. So for now, those of you still benefitting from your old Xbox may find them at their new site [xbmc4xbox.org.uk](https://www.xbmc4xbox.org.uk/ "XBMC4Xbox") until the hosting problems have been resolved. Plus, if you are still updating your old Xbox, it may be worth noting that their donation page is only a click away.
