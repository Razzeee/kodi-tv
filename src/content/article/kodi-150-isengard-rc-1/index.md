Here it is, the first Release Candidate (RC) built for Kodi 15.0; freshly baked and ready to be served! Although we said that Kodi 15.0 is a “clean-up” edition, we still managed to squeeze in a couple of really nice features. So far we had around 1050 code change requests which were included since Kodi 14.2. This vast amount sums up in a pretty big list of improvements and clean-up being done by various developers for which we should show our everlasting gratitude. As such we will only highlight some of the bigger changes further on. Download link is also provided at the bottom.

 Google Play
-----------

 Without a doubt the biggest news this year has been that Kodi is now [available in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi). You can download it at the previous link or using the following QR code.

 The version currently available on Google Play is Isengard 15.0 RC 1 (could take some time before it’s available as servers update). We’ve decided to go with Isengard instead of Kodi 14.2 as the first release for Google Play, because it is dramatically more prepared for the feature set that modern Android devices like the Nexus Player and the [NVIDIA Shield](https://youtu.be/0MH73mhO0fM "NVIDIA Shield Android TV Review") Android TV bring to the table, including support for 4K and HEVC, among other things.

 The benefits of installing the Google Play version of Kodi are fairly simple. You always get the most recent stable release without needing to mess with finding, downloading, and sideloading apks. With that said, we will continue to publish apks on our site, so if you’d rather sideload, or if your Android device doesn’t have Google Play, we’ve still got you covered. You should be able to install the Play Store version on top of your current Kodi install without any problems.
