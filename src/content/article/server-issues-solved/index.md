We are pleased to announce that the XBMC download and addon servers are back up and running. We’ve switched over to some newer, faster hardware, and after a few hiccups, it appears the problems that have been hounding us for the past week or so have finally been resolved.

The only remaining issue is one we cannot fix on this end. If you are a user that managed to download and install a skin over the past few days, and that skin is missing textures or otherwise doesn’t look exactly right, you may need to delete and reinstall it. To do so, you will need to navigate to the packages folder inside your [userdata folder](https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata "XBMC Userdata "), delete the skin zip file, and then open XBMC, uninstall the skin, and then reinstall it. This issue will likely affect a very, very limited minority of users, but for those it does affect, don’t hesitate to ask questions in the [forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/ "XBMC Forum") if you have issues.

For everyone else, downloads are up and running. Feel free to browser some of our [addons](http://addons.xbmc.org/ "Video Addons") and download to your heart’s content, or get to [downloading XBMC](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "Download XBMC") itself.
