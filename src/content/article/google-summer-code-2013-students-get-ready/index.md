We are excited to announce to everyone that we have been accepted as an official [GSOC 2013 mentor organization this year](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/xbmc "XBMC at GSOC"). GSoC 2012 was an incredible success for XBMC and XBMC users, as our Library, scrapers, and media server services took a massive leap forward, and we got an awesome test suite as icing on the cake. We have high hopes that students will come up with yet more brilliant ideas for this summer.

 Alternatively, feel free to jump into the #XBMC IRC room on Freenode and chat about any project you’d love to cover or visit our dedicated [GSoC 2013 forum area](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=191 "GSOC 2013 Development forum"), where other users, potential mentors, and team members can give you feedback on your idea.

 From April 22nd to May 3rd, we encourage any interested students to apply at the [GSOC home page](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013 "GSOC home page") to work with XBMC. After that, we’ll notify applicants whether we get to work with each other according to the [GSOC schedule](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013 "GSOC Schedule").

 All of us at Team XBMC are looking forward to getting some good work done this summer, and we’d love for you all to work with us!
