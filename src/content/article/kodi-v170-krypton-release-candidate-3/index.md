Just before New Years’s day we released our first official Release Candidate which marks the final step towards the final release of v17.0. These Release Candidate builds are dedicated to gain further feedback from users who are willing to take the jump towards v17 and we sure are grateful if they do as that provides valuable information on general stability and usability. Our team will certainly try to tackle as much of the reported problems as possible with the limited resources we have. We do want to note that since we are just a small team some of the reported bugs might not get fixed due to lack of developers or time. As such we would certainly welcome any developer who has the ability to help us out to try and fix the bugs he or she encounters and submit it to our code base for review. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with answering their questions.

 ### Fixes done in this release candidate:

 • Update Estuary with some bugfixes and improvements  
 • Revert change that cause video playback problems on some files  
 • Fix mouse not reaching right side of the screen on OSX  
 • Several fixes regarding general video playback  
 • Several fixes regarding EPG/PVR  
 • Several fixes and improvements regarding cmake build system  
 • Update to CEC 4.0.1

 What’s new?
-----------

 In our first Release Candidate announcement we’ve already covered most of the new features. Should you have missed this you can of course still read up on it here: [Kodi v17.0 “Krypton” Release Candidate](/article/kodi-v170-krypton-release-candidate)

 Krypton nightly builds
----------------------

 As you may have noticed we only release a new beta or release candidate once in a while that includes a list of fixes that were done since previous release. Additionally we also create these so called *nightly builds* specifically for Krypton that include the latest fixes that our developers have included and will end up in the next beta, release candidate or final release. By providing these builds we hope that users who install these will help us confirm the problem was fixed or identify if we accidentally created a regression from previous builds made. These nightlies are safe to install on top of the Kodi v17 you already have installed on your device and can be found on the download page. Be sure to get these builds from the ***Krypton*** folder and not from any other.

 Conclusion
----------

 Should you want to download and install this build please visit our download page. You can install these build just on top of your current Kodi installation without doing a reinstall or cleanup as we do a full migration if needed.
