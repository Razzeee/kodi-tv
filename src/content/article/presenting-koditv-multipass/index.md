This is going to be short and sweet: we proudly present KodiTV™ MultiPass!

 Starting at 00:00 UTC, our servers will deploy an update to your Kodi install if you're in North America (Canada not included) or Europe. Unfortunately the broadcasting rights don't allow us to offer the service to other regions yet. More on that later.

 KodiTV™ offers the best of all major content providers, combined in one single add-on. Starting now, we will support five streaming providers, with more to come:

 
 * Netflix
 * HULU
 * HBO
 * Amazon Prime
 * Youtube Premium
 
 KodiTV™ add-on will give you four subscription tiers:

 
 * Micropass: $0.99 per movie and $0.29 per TV show episode from any of our content providers (any content provider)
 * MultiPass: $14.99/month from up to three of our content providers (providers selectable each month)
 * Megapass: $23.99/month all providers right at your finger tips
 * Monsterpass : watch everything for $199 a year (unlimited tier)
 
 Have fun! ;

 **UPDATE:** Unfortunately, due to a legal notice received from Lirpa, Loof, Rantzen & Partners on behalf of 14 content providers, we have had to suspend the Kodi MultiPass Service indefinitely.
