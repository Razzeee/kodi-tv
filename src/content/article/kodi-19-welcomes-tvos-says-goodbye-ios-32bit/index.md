Dear Users,

 In the upcoming Kodi 19, **tvOS** will be added as new platform. It will be fully featured, supporting top-shelf* and the Siri remote, with support for both the Apple 4 and 4K. Similar to iOS, it will require jailbreaking or side loading.

 We wanted to thank **Memphiz** for the base on which this effort was completed and to **davilla** from MrMC for his support. Thanks also to team members **sy6sy2** for being brave enough to start tackling this, and to **kambala** and **Fuzzard** for contributing the lion's share of the work.

 Unfortunately, in order to keep things maintainable, we have decided that iOS 32-bit will no longer be supported from Kodi 19 onwards. We understand this will affect our users, and we don't make this decision lightly. As a small team of volunteers, we have to balance maintainability and the time it takes to add new features in the future.

 It's also important to note that iOS 32-bit users are not being abandoned: they will, of course, have Kodi 18 to run on indefinitely. From Kodi 19 the oldest iOS devices supported will be the iPhone 5s, iPad Air, iPad mini 2 and iPod touch 6th gen.

 Cheers,

 phunkyfish

 ** top-shelf is not available with the free dev certificate*
