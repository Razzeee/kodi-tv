**Update:** There was a typo in Sigma’s press release and our resulting post. Their XBMC port was done on the [SMP 8656](https://www.sigmadesigns.com/set-top-box-iptv-hybrid-socs/) which supports Open GL ES. GLES will also be supported on Sigma’s recently announced [SMP 8910](https://www.sigmadesigns.com/), so this may be a potential target for XBMC as well.

For those asking “Will a potential XBMC port be possible for my xyz Sigma-based device?”, it is only a possibility if GLES 2.0 is supported.

For those who may have missed the [previous post](/article/xbmc-port-sigma), Sigma Designs announced last week that they have begun work on porting XBMC to run on their next-generation SOCs, and showed off their nascent project at the [2011 CES](https://www.ces.tech/). After meeting with a few Sigma employees, I wanted to give more detail into what is going on.

Sigma hired a 3rd party company to do their initial port, which is shown in the picture below. A proof-of-concept is up and running on their SMP8656, and while the GUI is choppy and playback is still not working, it is an impressive effort so far. There was a significant amount of i﻿nterest in the port from CES attendees, who quickly appreciated XBMC’s rich experience compared to the user interfaces usually found on Sigma-based hardware.

Sigma has also expressed an interest in working directly with XBMC developers rather than using an outside company. This leads to the possibility of full-time XBMC devs, which would be a win for everyone involved. We are looking into our options. If the collaboration succeeds, it is quite possible that some turn-key XBMC solutions could be in the works in the not-so-distant future.

This is getting interesting!

 To answer a few questions:

- The collaboration has just begun, the above is subject to change.
- Don’t expect to see a Sigma-based XBMC solution on shelves in the next few months. These things take time.
- The capabilities will depend on the SOC used, nothing is set in stone yet.
- Sigma takes the GPL seriously, as do we. We do not foresee any problems.
- XBMC may be launched as an application, or run as the main front-end, depending on what the vendor wants.
