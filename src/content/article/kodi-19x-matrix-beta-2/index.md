So, here we go again. Nothing earth-shattering, just a quick note to tell you that the second Beta of Kodi 19.x "Matrix" is now available for installation.

If you want to know the main features in this release series, please refer back to previous blog posts, especially the [Beta 1 announcement](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-19x-matrix-beta-1): this is entirely a bugfix release, so - as befits a second Beta - there are no new features over Beta 1.

By this stage, there should be no show-stopping bugs, and this release should be pretty reliable - just make sure you know how to roll back, just in case. Please: install, test, and give us clear feedback on any issues you uncover, either with the new features or perhaps with a regression in existing code. We can then work to resolve these before we go to full release.

You can get Beta 2 from [here](https://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/), or - if appropriate - our nightly PPA [here](https://launchpad.net/~team-xbmc/+archive/ubuntu/xbmc-nightly). If you're on Android, you can [enrol](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.xbmc.kodi) in our Beta programme and get updates directly from Google Play.

As usual, you can also see changes since Beta 1 [here](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/compare/19.0b1-Matrix...19.0b2-Matrix) or browse the merged PRs [here](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+milestone%3A%22Matrix+19.0-beta+2%22+is%3Aclosed).
