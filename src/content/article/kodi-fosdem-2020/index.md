## Kodi at FOSDEM 2020

Hello Belgium once again.

In the tradition of the last few years, members of Team Kodi will be present at FOSDEM in Brussels this weekend. If you live somewhere nearby or are attending, please feel free to come and meet some of our team members in person.

FOSDEM is an annual, volunteer-driven, non-commercial event that focuses on free and open source software development. It's primarily aimed at developers, although the talks and stands are open to anyone who's interested. Its main aim is to simply create a meeting place; it's a fantastic opportunity for people to mix, chat, share ideas, collaborate, promote awareness, and generally interact with like-minded individuals.

Every year, thousands of developers from all over the world descend on the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles to attend. This year, there will be representatives of projects such as Gnome, Mozilla, Debian, GitLab, LibreOffice, Apache - and of course some of the Kodi team as well. We won't have a stand this time, but in between attending talks and generally mingling, we'd love to meet with our friends in the community who might be reading this.

### Kodi Community Meeting

It doesn't matter whether you're a user or developer, whether you work with Kodi or something else, if you have commercial interests, or if you're simply curious. Pop along if you're interested; several Team Kodi members will be present to chat at your leisure.

#### Room J.1.106, Sunday 2nd February, 12:00-13:00.
