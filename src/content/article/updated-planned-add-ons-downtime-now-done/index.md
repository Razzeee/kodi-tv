[![](/images/blog/mirrorbrain.jpeg "mirrorbrain")](https://mirrorbrain.org/)Thanks to the excellent [mirrorbrain](https://mirrorbrain.org/) project, we will be upgrading the backend to our mirror system tomorrow to take advantage of some new features, some of them were even added at our request (thanks again Peter)! As a result, beta testers for the upcoming Dharma release may experience a brief downtime tomorrow afternoon (US time). While it has been designed to be a seamless upgrade, there is always room for the unexpected.

While the update is taking place, users will be unable to fetch or upgrade add-ons. Please watch for the all-clear here before submitting bug reports or reporting issues on the forum.

Update: Done! Users should have experienced less than than 1 minute of downtime.
