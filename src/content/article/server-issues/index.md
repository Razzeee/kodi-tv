If you’ve tried to download XBMC, update an addon, or download a new addon over the past few days, you may have noticed that our servers have been behaving poorly. Let me begin by assuring you that we believe we have tracked down the issue to a malfunctioning piece of code on our primary mirror server running MirrorBrain. Whether this malfunction is merely a symptom of a greater problem is still being assessed. Some good news is that this code is not affecting this blog, the forum, or the wiki. Some bad news is that the bug is making it very difficult to actually download XBMC or XBMC addons.

 More good news is that we can easily correct the results of the bug by hand. The bad is that the bug continues to create problems on a semi-regular basis. Unfortunately, until we get this resolved, downloads will continue to suffer on an intermittent basis.

 The moment we get this fully resolved, we’ll be certain to create a new blog post to let you know. In the meantime, please bear with us as we sort through this issue.

 Finally, for current users of XBMC who are not trying to install new addons, your current addons and other features should continue to work without issue. Users of a fresh install of XBMC may have some issues with addons that have unmet dependencies. Unfortunately there is little we can do about this until the situation is resolved.

 Thank you in advance for your patience.

 Additionally, if any users have happen to have a thorough knowledge of the innerworkings of MirrorBrain, feel free to speak up in the comments.
