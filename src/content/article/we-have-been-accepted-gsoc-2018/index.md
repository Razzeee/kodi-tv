 If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [project Ideas page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code/2018 "GSOC 2015 Kodi Ideas page") and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on. Weâ€™re excited to see what ideas you come up with! This page covers several idea we feel would fit the project however it is not an extensive list so new ideas are also welcome.
