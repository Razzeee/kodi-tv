We are excited to announce that Kodi has been [accepted as a Google Summer of Code 2015 project](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/kodi)! Students, as of the time of this publication, you have about 2 weeks to start thinking about project ideas.

If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [project Ideas page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code/2015 "GSOC 2015 Kodi Ideas page") and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on. We’re excited to see what ideas you come up with!
