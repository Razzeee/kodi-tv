Yesterday the new Raspberry Pi 4B was [unveiled](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/) with a revised spec that guarantees it will be super-popular with Kodi users. It brings 4K media support, faster CPUs, faster memory, faster Ethernet, faster USB, and now handles HEVC natively. It's a great update on the previous 3B+ model, and at $35 for the 1G model it's also a bargain, and we predict it will be a massively popular way to run Kodi via distro's like [LibreELEC](https://libreelec.tv/), [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/) and [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/).

 The 4B's board layout is different to previous models so upgrading (and new) users will need a new case – and what better to wrap a Pi 4B in than a **[Kodi Edition Flirc case](https://flirc.tv/more/kodi-edition-raspberry-pi-4-case)**!

 Retaining the design language that made the original case great, the Flirc case has been re-tooled to accommodate the Raspberry Pi 4B's ports and CPU placement ensuring **maximum cooling efficiency**. Otherwise it's the same winning formula and gorgeous design as the [previous 3B/3B+ Kodi Edition case](https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-case). The main body is Aluminium and designed to act as a heatsink that keeps the BCM2711 chip in your 4B cool. The top surface of the Aluminium has been mirror-polished to catch your eye, and the Kodi branded top uses soft-touch plastics so it not only looks great, it feels great too.

 Flirc is well into manufacturing and are offering an **early bird discount of 30%**. At USD $11.20 (normal price USD $15.95) that's a steal! – and orders will ship in late July. Flirc is also offering the 3B/3B+ case at the same discounted rate to clear remaining inventory.

 Team Kodi receives a royalty on each Kodi branded case sold – and alongside t-shirt sales it's one of the main sources of funding for the Kodi Foundation. Flirc also donate a percentage of the sale to Cancer research at the [USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://uscnorriscancer.usc.edu/), which plays a key role in personal back-story to Flirc.
