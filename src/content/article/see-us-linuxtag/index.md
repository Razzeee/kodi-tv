For the third year in a row we are going to exhibit on [LinuxTag](http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/en.html) in Berlin, Germany.

The exhibition is running from [![](/images/blog/LinuxTag-Logo-plain-yellow-300x193.jpeg "LinuxTag 2011")](/blittan/2011/04/12/see-us-at-linuxtag/linuxtag-logo-plain-yellow)May 11 to 14 at the Berlin Fairgrounds ([Messedamm 22](http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/en/visitors/directions.html "Directions")) in hall 7 (S-Bahn station Messe Süd, next to the Deutschlandhalle).

We will be in hall 7.2.a booth 101.

If you are in Berlin, come and join us in the booth for a chat, competitions and a walkthru of XBMC.

We will be running XBMC on Linux (ASRock ION 330), OSX (MacBook Pro), iOS (Apple TV 2, iPhone, perhaps iPad) and Windows (also MacBook Pro). Further Malard is bringing an OpenELEC htpc running XBMC and hopefully the new “XBMC” remote.

The ones attending seems to be me (blittan), mdd, vdrfan, probst and Malard. So we will be covering german, english and swedish languages.

For everyone using XBMC and on location in Berlin, we are thinking of having a meetup at some nice pub/bar and grab a few beers and chit chat with us?

Since we are not native Berliners, suggestion on good bars, pubs and restaurants are more than welcome.
