Kodi 17 features a huge amount of work in areas like video playback, live TV and PVR/DVR, the music library, skinning and more. It features a new default skin, as well as a new default touchscreen skin, named Estuary and Estouchy, respectively. With all this work done over the months some bugs might slip through and were hoping to quickly squash the coming beta releases. The changes for this fifth beta are the result of the continuous effort from the developers, either from inside the team or outside to get v17 into final release shape. and any outside. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with question. Below is a condensed list of fixes and changes done in this beta 5 release.

## Fixes done in this Beta 5:

• Fix playback of HLS streams  
 • Fix skin settings not loading when “reload skin” was triggered  
 • Fix segfault on EOF for video caused by postprocessing

## What’s new?

This round we didn’t really add new features as the focus was to further improve our code and solving possible bugs. We do have some more improvements lined up for next beta so stay tuned…….

Windows Store

[![KODI_BLOG_WIN_300x300_C](/images/blog/KODI_BLOG_WIN_300x300_C-160x160.jpeg)](/article/kodi-goes-windows-store)In case you missed the big news some time ago, Kodi got added to the Windows Store as a Desktop Bridge UWP app. It is still the same Kodi version you are used to use, without any limitations. Although it is still possible (and always will be) to download and install Kodi from our website, it is now also possible for Windows 10 users to download and install Kodi from the Windows Store. This brings a few benefits, such as automatic updating. The Windows Store application uses the same _userdata_ as the version from our website so you can switch between the two versions without issues. NOTE: This also means that if you are currently running Kodi v16 and want to try out the Windows Store version, your Kodi databases and add-ons will be upgraded to the v17 versions. You might want to make a backup of the userdata before! You can read the full announcement here: [Kodi goes Windows Store](/article/kodi-goes-windows-store)

**NOTE**: Since it takes a bit of time to publish in Windows Store you might need to wait a bit till the update is available.

All in all this Beta 5 might not seem very excited but that’s how it’s supposed to be. We’re simply focusing more on stability and working out the details than keep adding bells and whistles.
