It's that time again. After unleashing Kodi v18 Leia into the wild, it's time to give the upcoming Kodi 19 a codename.

 As usual, our users suggested a myriad of names, most right up our alley, some less... erm... "appropriate". After compiling suggestions from the **[community thread](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330506)**, **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/XBMC/posts/10155678872106641)** and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/KodiTV/status/1051454892571807744)**, we arrived at the top 10 list:

 
 * Magneto
 * Mars
 * Marvel
 * Marvin
 * Matrix
 * Megatron
 * Merlin
 * Metropolis
 * Mordor
 * Morpheus
 
 At first glance it seems a consensual list. Nothing out of the ordinary and, with the possible exception of "Mars", all science fiction related. Next, we needed to decide what to do: follow the users' top suggestion as we've done in the past? Have team members vote to decide the name? Or maybe pick a completely different codename for Kodi v19 – Kodi "Muppet", maybe? With so many great suggestions, we decided a team vote was the way to go.

 So we did, and "Matrix" won the vote. And then all hell broke loose. Some team members argued we should be less predictable and geeky, that we could use some out-of-the-box thinking, choose something completely different, etc. What ensued was truly horrific. Geeks cursed each other, pizza boxes got thrown, beer was spilled, perfectly-formatted CSS insults flew, moms' basements destroyed all over the world. I mean, spilled beer! Utter madness.

 Bottom line – with such a great list of suggestions and a team vote, we still couldn't reach an agreement. And, for a while, we actually contemplated settling for Kodi "MultiPass".

 Nahh, just kidding! The users have spoken, the team has voted and, in the end, geekiness has won!

 **Kodi "Matrix" it is.**
