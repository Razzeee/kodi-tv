Once again with Beta 3 we are looking at almost entirely fixes rather than features. Still, many of those fixes are worth mentioning in an abbreviated change log, and at least one is worth bringing up by name.

Ever since the release of iOS 7, Airplay support in XBMC has suffered. Fortunately, thanks to generous contributions from our users, the Foundation has been able to purchase hardware specifically for testing and development of this and related issues, and dev Memphiz appears to have finally resolved the majority of Airplay issues in this Beta release (except for Android for now). If you continue experiencing Airplay issues after installing beta 3, be certain to post about it in the forum and include a [debug log](https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy "XBMC Debug Log").

For a full rundown of the major features of XBMC 13, as well as a review of the hazards of switching to XBMC 13, see our [Beta 1 post](https://kodi.wiki/xbmc-13-0-gotham-beta1-rises/).

## Fixes

- - Android hardware video decoding support added to Exynos devices (such as Odroid or Exynos
- - Various video and audio playback fixes
- - Skip to DVD menu has now been brought on par with the automatic skip performed by VLC
- - Wii controller support on Linux
- - Language and description updates

## After upgrade

After you have updated from Frodo or any earlier alpha or beta it might pay of to force refresh the XBMC.org repository. This is to make sure the most recent repository list is loaded and needed updates become available. This could be the case when wanting to use the new subtitle downloading feature and you cannot find the new services to install. Doing it regardless doesn’t hurt. Here’s a quick how-to found on our wiki: [Force refresh](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager)

## The Shirt

From the entire dev team to so many of you, we would like to say thank you for banding together on this t-shirt sale. If you revisit the sale page, you’ll see that we sold just a touch over 1200 shirts, which translates to roughly 1/3rd the entire price of the 2014 upcoming Developer’s Conference. To put it more simply, our users just single-handledly assured us that the team would be able to get together this year and dramatically further development, just as was done last year.

We’d also like to apologize to those who weren’t able to purchase the shirt. As a general rule, when these things are done, they’re done forever. However, this time it really was just a simple, plain XBMC shirt. It may one day make a comeback. You’ll have to keep your eyes open though.
