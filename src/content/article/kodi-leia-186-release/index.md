And.... here we are again. The latest Kodi release in the 18.x "Leia" cycle, with more (count them!) and better (measure them!) bug fixes for your various delight, delectation, and delirious... discussion?

18.6 is here. More nasty (and not-so-nasty) problems fixed, more bugs squashed, more happiness and love for all. This release is all about backports: where practical, we've brought bug fixes forwards from the forthcoming 19.x release, so you get the benefit sooner rather than later.

As usual, you can find full details of closed pull requests [on GitHub](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+milestone%3A%22Leia+18.6%22+label%3A%22v18+Leia%22), so explore that if you want the details, but the summary would be...

The nature of point releases is that most of these changes won't be visible to most people unless they address a specific problem you've stumbled across. That said, they're all real bugs, and real fixes, so thanks as always to all who found a bug, took the time to report it and, in some cases, provided a fix.

The full v18.6 changelog can be found in our GitHub [milestone](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/compare/18.5-Leia...18.6-Leia). If you want to read back on what was actually changed in v18 itself, you can find the corresponding articles in the blog posts - [Kodi 18](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-180), [Kodi 18.1](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-v181-leia-rc1), [Kodi 18.2](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-leia-182-release), [Kodi 18.3](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-leia-183-release), [Kodi 18.4](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-leia-184-release) and [Kodi 18.5](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-leia-185-release).

Application deployment on different platforms (notably, Google Play and the Microsoft Store) varies due to circumstances outside of our control. It may thus take a few more days to appear everywhere, so just stay tuned.
