The XBMC team is proud to present our first ARM-based release, and it’s a big one. Scott Davilla, with the help of Edgar (gimli) Hucek and Zeljko (amet) Ametovic and several other developers and testers, is finally ready to pull the curtain off of his fun little secret.

You know that [$99 tiny form-factor powerhouse](https://www.apple.com/tv/) that would be just perfect if it could only run XBMC? Now it can.  
 Or how about that iPad that is just begging to be used as a real portable media center? Now it can.  
 And while we’re at it, put your iPhone4 to work using XBMC as well. Why? Because we can.

These are not initial ports, and they are not early development snapshots. Here they are: full XBMC installs and [source code](https://github.com/xbmc/atv2), ready for consumption.

## AppleTV2

This thing may fit in your pocket, but don’t underestimate its power. Unfortunately, it is seriously lacking in capability due to its limited feature-set revolving around rentals and iTunes. Where’s the fun in that?

- Full XBMC install, this is not a remote or thin client streamer.
- No longer is your AppleTV2 chained to iTunes.
- Who wants transcoded video anyway?
- Share files on your network your way.
- Full hardware decode for 720p/1080p movies.
- Everything else you know and love about XBMC.

## iPad/iPhone4

What good is a tablet that makes you play by its rules? We at XBMC want our media our way.

- You guessed it, this is full-blown XBMC. Not a remote.
- Launch XBMC like any other app.
- Drag and drop media from your computer, or share it on your home-network
- Also fully hardware accelerated for most formats.
- Works on iPhone4, though it’s currently frustrating to use.
- Challenge: Who will be the first to create a gesture-driven skin?

## Availability

As you might have guessed, you won’t be seeing XBMC in the app-store any time soon, since it directly competes with apple products. XBMC will only be installable for those of you with jailbroken devices. If that’s you, head to the wiki for instructions for the [atv2](https://kodi.wiki/view/Install_XBMC_on_ATV2) or [ipad/iphone](https://kodi.wiki/view/Install_XBMC_on_iPhone/iPad).
