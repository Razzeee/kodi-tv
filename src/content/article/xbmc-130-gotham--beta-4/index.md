With Beta 4 we are only looking at bug fixing rather than features. Further down we will list several of the more important fixes that have been added since last beta. Hopefully Beta 4 will be the last one, before we will enter Release Candidate stage. This means final release is nearing.

For a full run down of the major features of XBMC 13, as well as a review of the hazards of switching to XBMC 13, see our [Beta 1 post](https://kodi.wiki/xbmc-13-0-gotham-beta1-rises/). The list of all Gotham related news can be found [here](https://kodi.wiki/tag/gotham/) listing all past blog posts.

## After upgrade

After you have updated from Frodo or any earlier alpha or beta it might pay of, to force refresh the XBMC.org repository. This is to make sure the most recent repository list is loaded and needed updates become available. This could be the case when wanting to use the new subtitle downloading feature and you cannot find the new services to install. Doing it regardless doesn’t hurt. Here’s a quick how-to found on our wiki: [Force refresh](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager)

## Skins

Creating a skin for XBMC takes many months of designing, coding, testing, tweaking and a lot of patience to get it just right. However with every major XBMC release there is the problem of skins becoming incompatible due to various code changes. So for every release people who put a lot of effort creating these skins, need to adapt it for the next XBMC version. This could mean that your favourite skin doesn’t work in the next XBMC version. We are very glad to say, that thanks to a group of skin developers, there are already 9 Gotham compatible skins available in XBMC.org repository. From memory this has never happened before, that within beta stage there are that many already available for you to enjoy using. On our forum there are several more skins being worked on, to get these into shape for people to use. So hopefully by the time of final release, there will be several more available. So let’s all thank the developers for their hard work they do for the XBMC community.

[https://kodi.wiki/view/Main_Page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Main_Page) is the only official place anything XBMC related. This includes news, announcements, information or XBMC downloads. There are of course manufacturers who also provide support with customized XBMC versions, tailored for their devices. Should you have purchased from them it would be wise to first check, if it’s a known issue with that specific version. Any other third-party websites, offering you XBMC installations, or people offering you pre-installed devices, are not officially supported by Team XBMC and may contain unwanted and unsupported additions, changes and add-ons. Installing these versions is at your own risk. XBMC does not provide any media content on it’s own and comes with no add-ons installed regarding this. Should you have problems please contact the correct add-on developer or website should you experience any issues.
