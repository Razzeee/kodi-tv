[nVidia](http://nvidia.com "nVidia") have been kind enough to loan one of our devs (motd2k) an [ION](https://www.nvidia.com/object/sff_ion.html "ION") reference box that we can use to showcase XBMC at [Linuxtag](/xbmc-will-have-a-booth-at-linuxtag-2009-in-berlin "Linuxtag 2009").

It has what appears to be an Atom 230 processor, so compilation of XBMC took just over an hour, but thanks to hardware accelerated video decoding, [performance while running XBMC is awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv1Q_DWieAQ)

More pics are available in the [forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=51519), and if you want to see it in action, get to Linuxtag in Berlin, June 24-27.
