Belgium, here we come! Team Kodi will be at FOSDEM in Brussels next week. If you live anywhere near, if you're attending, if you can make the detour - please, come along and meet some of the team.

 FOSDEM is an annual, volunteer, non-commercial event that focuses on free and open source software development. It's primarily aimed at developers, although the talks and stands are open to anyone who's interested. Its main aim is to simply create a meeting place; it's a fantastic opportunity for people to mix, chat, share ideas, collaborate, promote awareness, and generally interact with like-minded individuals. 

 So, every year, thousands of developers from all over the world descend on the *Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles* to do just that. This year, there'll be representatives of projects such as Gnome, Mozilla, Debian, Python, GitLab, LibreOffice, Apache, VideoLAN (and many, many more) - and some of the Kodi team as well. We won't have a stand but, in between attending and delivering talks and generally mingling, we'd love to meet with our friends in the community who might be reading this.

  

 ### **Kodi v18 "Leia" Presentation**

 **Martijn** from the team will be presenting the final release of Kodi 18, the next release in everyone's favourite media centre software. He will be taking people through the latest features to be introduced, as well as some of the changes that have been made "behind the scenes", and what these mean for developers and users. He'll also set the scene for what you can expect as we now build on these foundations and move in earnest towards v19 development.

 **Room** **H.1309**, **Saturday 2nd February**, **11:00-11:25**.

 ### 

 ### **Kodi Team Meetup**

 It doesn't matter whether you're a user or developer, whether you work with Kodi or something else, if you have commercial interests, or if you're simply curious. Pop along if you're interested; several Team Kodi members will be present to chat at your leisure.

 **Room** **H.3242**, **Saturday 2nd February**, **16:00-17:00**.
