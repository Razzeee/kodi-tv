![camelot](/images/blog/logo.jpeg "camelot")It’s been quite a while in the making (and maybe a bit late), but Camelot has arrived for Windows, OSX, Linux, and XBMC Live, and just in time for the holidays. Noteworthy changes include a revamped user interface via the new default skin “[Confluence](/skins/confluence)“, DirectX support by default for the Windows platform, a complete reorganization of the settings menus, automatic video information extraction, and smoother video playback. In addition, all scrapers have been updated, new remotes are supported out of the box, and codecs have been updated for more reliable playback. For a full changelog, see the end of this post.

Look to the [download page](https://kodi.wiki/download/) for the good stuff. We wish to thank our community for helping to make XBMC what it is. Several new [skins](/slideshow/skins) and [plugins](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=26) have been created since Babylon, be sure to check them out as well.

For the developers, this is where the fun starts. To quote the great Linus Torvalds, “A release is not so much of a birth of a new version, it’s more of a laying-to-rest of an old one. It’s also an end to a fairly quiet period.” It’s now open-season for us to start looking forward and begin merging in all those new features that have been brewing. Enjoy our latest offering as we get back to work!

As a brief aside, we’re looking to recruit a talented web developer as well as a graphics designer for a few future endeavors. If you’re interested in more detail and have serious skills (no weekend warriors please), [drop us a line](https://kodi.wiki/about/contact/).

**Update**: It looks like there’s a problem with the live installer causing installation to fail. Please hold tight while we look into it.

**Update #2:** Turns out the live issue was brought on by a last-minute upstream change. We’ll get this fixed ASAP, though due to the holidays, we ask for your patience.

**Update #3\*\***:\*\* Download links updated for 9.11 repack. Installer should now work correctly.
