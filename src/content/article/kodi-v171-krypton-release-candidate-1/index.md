This is the Release Candidate for our upcoming bugfix release v17.1 “Krypton” which contains our continuous effort to further improve the v17 release. Our team will certainly try to tackle as much of the reported problems as possible with the limited resources we have. We do want to note that since we are just a small team some of the reported bugs might not get fixed due to lack of developers or time. As such we would certainly welcome any developer who has the ability to help us out to try and fix the bugs he or she encounters and submit it to our code base for review. We sure would like to thank every one involved with either development, testing or simply helping out others with answering their questions.

### Fixes done in this release candidate:

• Update Estuary and Estouchy with some bugfixes and improvements  
• Fix EDL skipping  
• Fix slow song smartplaylist  
• Several PVR fixes  
• Update Chorus webinterface  
• Fix addons not being marked broken when they are updated with broken flag  
• Add limiter on random songs which should prevent large memory usage on big libraries  
• Improve keyboard mapping during button mapping  
• Improve analog stick handling  
• Improve plugin performance when building the content list  
• Include RTMP inputstream add-on for Windows

## What’s new?

You can read up on all the v17 changes here: [Kodi v17.0 “Krypton”](/kodi17)

## Krypton nightly builds

As you may have noticed we only release a new beta or release candidate once in a while that includes a list of fixes that were done since previous release. Additionally we also create these so called _nightly builds_ specifically for Krypton that include the latest fixes that our developers have included and will end up in the next release candidate or final release. By providing these builds we hope that users who install these will help us confirm the problem was fixed or identify if we accidentally created a regression from previous builds made. These nightlies are safe to install on top of the Kodi v17 you already have installed on your device and can be found on the download page. Be sure to get these builds from the **_Krypton_** folder and not from any other.

## Conclusion

Should you want to download and install this build please visit our download page. You can install these build just on top of your current Kodi installation without doing a reinstall or cleanup as we do a full migration if needed.

### Bug reports

Please report any problems on our forum [http://forum.kodi.tv](https://forum.kodi.tv/) and not on the release announcement as it is not a reporting or help section. Don’t forget we also have some official tablet/phone remote controls for both Android and iOS. You can find the links to them on the download page.

### Donations or getting involved

Getting involved is quite easy. Simply take the plunge and start using these 17.0 Krypton builds. If you use these builds, we encourage you to report problems with these builds on our forum first and after that, if asked, submit bugs on Trac (following this guide: [How to submit a bug report](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Submit_a_bug_report)). Do note that we need detailed information so we can investigate the issue. We also appreciate providing support in our [Forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/ "Kodi Forums") where you can. You can of course also follow or help promote Kodi on all available social networks. Read more on the [get involved](/get-involved) page. We are always happy to receive a [donation](/contribute/donate "Donate") by which you show your support and appreciation, and t-shirts and Raspberry Pi cases may still be found on the sidebar for purchase. All donations and other income goes towards the XBMC foundation and are typically used for travel to attend conferences, any necessary paperwork and legal fees, purchasing necessary hardware and licenses for developers and hopefully the yearly XBMC Foundation Developers Conference.
