UPDATE: 24 December 2016

..and with those wise words, it’s time to bring our search to a closure.

over the course of the upcoming days, our team members will spend some time going through the list of all suggested names,  
 we’ll be counting, re-counting, checking and double-checking and trying very hard not to place our personal favourites at the top spot ![;-)](/images/blog/icon_wink.gif)

and big thanx to all of our users who have participated, the amount of feedback we’ve received has been simply amazing!  
 as soon as possible we will let you know which name we’ve selected as the name for Kodi v18,  
 but for now.. happy holidays, season greetings and a very merry Christmas to all of you!

Since the dawn of time, or at least since 2008 each released version has received a code name next to the version number. Giving each development iteration a code name in a certain category is kind of a tradition that is not only applicable for software but also for hardware. Google does so for Android and Intel also names their chips. Who are we to break this tradition and as such we follow in their steps with a theme that started out with mythical places or names.

With Kodi v17 _Krypton_ heading towards final release (just waiting on some fixes) we’ ll need a new code name that will be added to v18 which our developers are already working on. Don’t worry we’ll still look after any bug that might pop up in Krypton and try to fix it first.
