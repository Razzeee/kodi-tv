    title: Kodi v19.1 (Matrix)
    description: Kodi for MacOS runs natively on Mac OSX. Mac OSX can provide
      hardware video decoding for H.264 and MPEG2 video, though most CPUs are
      able to use software decoding for other formats in 1080 as well. Macs can
      use the Apple TV remote, among others, for control of Kodi. An Intel Mac
      running OS X 10.13 or higher is required.

    description: >-
      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent
      changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should
      only be used by testers and advanced users to help us find possible bugs.


      **THESE BUILDS MAY BE UNSTABLE** so be sure to always backup before using a development build.


      If you want a stable setup, then please install a stable build from the **Recommended** tab instead.
