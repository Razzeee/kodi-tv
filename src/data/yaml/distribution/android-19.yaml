      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent
      changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should
      only be used by testers and advanced users to help us find possible bugs.


      **THESE BUILDS MAY BE UNSTABLE** so be sure to always backup before using a development build.


      If you want a stable setup, then please install a stable build from the **Recommended** tab instead.
